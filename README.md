# covid19-descriptive-predictive-analysis

This project centers around the descriptive and predictive analysis for the data set of COVID-19 outbreak and
potential predictive features in the USA. The data set provides information related to the
outbreak of COVID-19 disease in the United States, including data from its counties and states.
The data set includes confirmed cases, deaths, and different features that may prove relevant to
the pandemic dynamics.The project is split into two parts. 

Descriptive Analysis is organized as follows. Section I contains the descriptive analysis, including a
general description of the dataset, state and county wise analysis, distribution analysis and trends
of the target variables, as well as correlation analysis and mean comparison between target
groups. The results from this analysis were then be employed to aid the prediction of COVID-19
confirmed cases and deaths in the USA. 

Predictive Analysis is organized as follows. Section I contains the predictive analysis, including a
description of the variable selection methods, the regression model used to predict COVID-19
confirmed cases and deaths, bootstrap coefficients for the regression model and model
performance evaluation. Section II concludes the report with a summary of the findings and
recommendations for next steps.
